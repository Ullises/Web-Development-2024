<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a current student for web development, I majored in Data Engineering also because of that I want to learn Web Development to be able to combine it 
  with my degree and become a resourceful professional in the tech industry. I am a very dedicated person and I am always looking to learn new things and improve my skills
  upon time I am planning to learn more about the front and back end of web development and seek for new job opportunities 
</p>

<p>One of my first jobs I have was as a telemarketing adviser working for an outsourcing company called MDY, we use to sell cellphone minutes or exclusive offers
  to users that wanted to change from cellphone company. I was a very good seller and I was able to sell a lot of minutes and exclusive offers to the users.
  I was able to get quite a few bonusses however I was not happy with the job and I decided to quit and look for a new job.
</p>

<p>My second experience with a formal job this time was in a company called Balfour which is one of the largest commencement companies all accross the US, 
  I was a customer service representative and I was in charge of taking calls from customers that wanted to buy graduation pictures and other products that the company offered.
  I was able to learn a lot about customer service and how to deal with customers that were not happy with the service, I was able to learn how to deal with stress and how to
  manage time and work under pressure.
